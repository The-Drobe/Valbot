## Disclamer
I and the other devlopers are not responsible for bricked devices,
dead SD cards, data loss, thermonuclear war, or economic crisis caused by
Valbot. YOU are choosing to use this application, and if you
point your finger at me for messing up your device or account, I will laugh at you.

## Important Notice:

I am yet to update the old anti afk detection system so use at your own risk

## Discord Server:
[Fums Community Server](https://discord.gg/RDgbSsKTS5)



## Features

* Fully AFK XP farmer

* Optimized and has fail safes for events that may happen during runtime of the game
* Restarts Valorant if detects an issue with it / detects that it isn't running
* Automated restarts to prevent script from ending prematurely 
* Undetected 
* Easy navigation
* Can set XP targets and XP limits


## Requirements

Only works on 1920 x 1080 resolution. If you wish to make the bot work with a different resolution other than 1920 x 1080, you need to get your own version of the images for the bot to recognize. Read on how to do this [here](https://github.com/MrFums/Valbot/blob/master/information/change_resolution.txt).

Run the batch file as Administator to install the dependencies. 
Seems to only work on 64bit Windows 10 with Python 3.9 

For the program to function properly, please copy and paste your OWN Valorant shortcut for the program to function properly. This makes it so if Valorant encounters any issues when AFK, it can restart the game. You should not need to edit any code.

You also need a functioning brain, please have one of these; it's very important.

You should also read the [saftey precautions](https://github.com/MrFums/Valbot/blob/master/information/safetyprecautions.txt) to keep your account safe while running Valbot.

### Windows installation

You will have to have a few things installed before running Valbot. This installation guide assumes that you are on a 64bit Windows system.

First, you will need to install Python. It's recommended to use either version `3.9.0` or `3.8.6`. You must use a Python version above `3.7`. 

### Installing Python

Go to the following link and download Python:

[https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.0/python-3.9.0-amd64.exe)

Once you have opened the installer, make sure that you add Python to path. Your installer should look like this:

Run through the installer as normal, then download the Valbot files.


## Download

[Download here](https://github.com/MrFums/Valbot/releases/latest)

Click on the zip file that says `Valbot-X.X.X` and unzip to where you would like the bot to be stored. Be advised to not put this in an Admin only folder as the bot must write the folder it is in to manage the `config.ini` file it creates.


## Instructions

1- Install Python 3.9.0.

2- Open `PackageInstaller.bat` as admin to install pakcages using pip. Do this after every update to maintain functionality.

3- Open `Valbot.py` and read the bot console.

4- Navigate the menu and read the information.

5- Put your Valorant shortcut in the bots directory.

6- Follow the instructions that will appear on screen if you haven't already.

7- If you encounter issues please [create one](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/issues/new) or if you have suggestions please create a [pull request](https://github.com/MrFums/ValBot/compare)

8- (Optional) Setup a Discord webhook to get updates to your discord server for when the bot has completed a game.
